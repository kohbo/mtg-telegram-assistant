## What can this bot do?
- get cards and pricing via scryfall
- get card rulings
- stores DCI numbers for each player

## Quickstart
Still to be defined, however
1. clone this repo
2. generate a token with botfather 
3. edit file Config/config.json with your favourite text editor
4. turn off bot privacy setting
5. add the bot to your LGS telegram group
6. turn off bot "can be added to groups" setting
7. customize your bot: make it fancy!
8. start the bot

##Further improvements

- handle FNM subscriptions
- auto sync with your LGS events posted on facebook
- auto fetch DCI planeswalker points
- language localisation

the following improvements are supposed to be implemented by integrating a flask server in the bot:

- internal leaderboard to handle tournaments
- event creation
- match tracker for every single event

## Documentation
I will provide in-detailed documentation in the wiki section, along with usage description and so on.
Because the bot is still a work in progress, implementing it in such an early stage just makes no sense at all.
